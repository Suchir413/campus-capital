          🗞 <strong>Campus Capital Weekly: The “Big Beautiful Bill” Crossroads</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          🧩 <strong>Trump vs. Musk: A Feud with Fiscal Consequences</strong><br />
          The feud between former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk has
          evolved from verbal jabs into a full‑scale political rupture. Musk,
          once a Trump ally, now criticises his “Big Beautiful Bill” for lacking
          fiscal discipline, arguing it would deepen the deficit. Trump fired
          back with threats over federal contracts and public insults —
          escalating tensions that could fracture GOP unity just as the bill
          faces a razor‑thin vote in Congress.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This isn’t just personal drama — it’s political leverage.” The rift
          may cost Trump crucial support: the bill passed the House by just one
          vote, and any defection in the Senate could derail it entirely.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-section">
        <h3>The Bill That Could Break Congress</h3>
        <p>
          Dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” the legislation combines tax reform
          and spending measures aimed at permanent rate cuts. But with divided
          views, one Senate change could send it back to the House, risking
          collapse before midterms. Even if passed, the final version will look
          drastically different. Fiscal hawks question its sustainability, and
          the CBO’s projections don’t factor in potential growth from tax cuts,
          skewing public perception.
        </p>
        <p>
          If tax cuts expire, it would mark the largest tax hike in U.S. history
          — making permanence a political must for conservatives.

        <h3>Fiscal Responsibility: The New Political Currency</h3>
        <p>
          The debate has thrust fiscal responsibility back into public
          discourse. Yet in an age dominated by short‑form content, capturing
          voter attention on deficits and budgets is harder than ever. Candidates
          who can frame fiscal policy simply — and persuasively — may define the
          coming election cycle.

        <h3>Global Tensions & Economic Undercurrents</h3>
        <p>
          While U.S. politics roil, China trade tensions and the Russia–Ukraine
          war continue shaping global supply chains. A distracted Washington
          invites opportunity for rivals; with Musk distancing from Trump, foreign
          markets may perceive weakened U.S. cohesion.

        <h3>Markets: Overbought but Still Running</h3>
        <p>
          Despite the noise, markets remain resilient: half of all stocks trade
          above their 50‑day moving average, NYSE breadth sits at all‑time highs
          and money flow is strongly positive. Analysts warn of a potential
          correction during the upcoming buyback blackout window (August 30 –
          September 30) — but until then, momentum favours the bulls.

        <h3>Earnings & Consumer Spending: The Real Drivers</h3>
        <p>
          Earnings remain the market’s heartbeat — and they’re closely tied to
          consumer spending. During pandemic stimulus, corporate earnings surged
          alongside household personal consumption expenditures. Now, spending is
          normalising and earnings are softening, signalling a return to
          sustainable growth. “As consumers go, so goes the S&P.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Watch for discrepancies between earnings growth and cash flow, which
          often hint at accounting manipulation or over‑optimistic guidance.
        </p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>
          The Trump–Musk feud is more than spectacle — it could decide fiscal
          direction and party control. The “Big Beautiful Bill” teeters on the
          edge of collapse, with politics outweighing policy. Markets remain
          overbought but buoyant; earnings and spending remain the true north
          star for investors. Fiscal restraint, not social‑media warfare, may be
          the deciding vote of the next cycle.

        <h3>Data Visualisation</h3>
        <p>
          The chart below illustrates how markets have historically rebounded
          after declines of 25% or more. In past downturns, the average return
          one year after a 25% fall was roughly +21%, with gains of around +90%
          after five years【580567232906559†L65-L99】. Staying invested through the
          turbulence has historically delivered better outcomes than trying to
          time the market.

        <h3>Investing Psychology</h3>
        <p>
          Numbers and data aren’t the only factors driving financial markets;
          human emotions play a significant role in market fluctuations. Investors
          are often driven by emotions like fear and greed, which can lead to
          market anomalies and inefficiencies【979717615078037†L156-L165】. Understanding
          the psychology behind investor behaviour can help you keep a level head
          when markets are turbulent.
