        <h2>About Suchir</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Suchir Padarthi, a senior at Rick Reedy High School in Frisco,
          Texas and the founder of Campus Capital. My fascination with markets
          began during a conversation with my dad about market psychology – the
          idea that markets aren’t just math, they’re collective human behaviour
          made visible. Since then, I’ve worked as a market analyst intern at
          Q‑Data, producing bond and equity reports; completed a VC analyst
          internship evaluating early‑stage startups; founded DIGI‑LEAP to teach
          Python and machine learning; and studied behavioural economics and
          technical analysis obsessively. Campus Capital started as a way to
          organise my own research. When friends and classmates started asking
          for my notes, I realised there was a gap: most financial analysis is
          either too technical for beginners or too simplified to be useful. I
          created Campus Capital to bridge that gap.

        <h2>Why I Started Campus Capital</h2>
        <p>
          Most financial literacy content for students is either too basic (for
          example, “What is a stock?”) or too advanced (PhD‑level econometrics),
          and much of it sits behind paywalls. Campus Capital exists to provide
          high‑level market analysis that’s accessible to anyone with an
          internet connection. I use Python to scrape market data and generate
          visualisations, ensuring every claim is backed by data, not
          speculation.

        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Markets are unforgiving. They reward execution and discipline and
          punish recklessness. But they’re also predictable – not in their
          day‑to‑day moves, but in their patterns. Human psychology drives
          markets, and human psychology hasn’t changed in centuries. That’s what
          I write about in Campus Capital.
